# dotfiles

I'm currently experimenting with [`chezmoi`](https://www.chezmoi.io/) as a *simple and straight forward* way of managaing my dotfiles and basic machine setup.

Dev machines:
- Apple M1 Pro, 32GB, 14-in
- Apple M3 Pro Max, 48GB, 16-in

## Basics

`install.sh`

Basic script to install packages and applications that aren't managed by Homebrew. 

`Brewfile`

For all applications that I only need one version of and which the version doesn't matter, I use Homebrew.
